## Why?

This project was built to test the performance of Chromium-based browsers, including Chrome, Brave, Turbo, Edge and Opera, across a number of different real-world sites.

The aim was to see whether there was any noticeable performance advantages of using any particular browser on desktop, in combination with a number of different content-blocking extensions, including Adblock Plus.

Eventually the goal is to the produce relative performance stats for all the Chromium-based browsers and content-blocking extensions remotely.
