## Why?

This project was built to test the performance of Chromium-based browsers, including Chrome, Brave, Turbo, Edge and Opera, across a number of different real-world sites.

The aim was to see whether there was any noticeable performance advantages of using any particular browser on desktop, in combination with a number of different content-blocking extensions, including Adblock Plus.

At some point the goal is to the produce relative performance stats for all the Chromium-based browsers and content-blocking extensions.

## How to use?

Copy the build folder to your local machine and load it unpacked from the Extensions management page in your browser.

The build folder contains the minified version of all the code in the src directory, plus the public directory.
